      <h3>Why dropping out of private school to attend community college was the best decision I ever made</h3>
<img src="img/collegedropout.jpg" alt="" width="696" height="522" />

<p>Upon graduation, I set sail to continue both my running and academic career at a small private college in Ohio. Why the fuck would I leave the greatest city in the world and escape to the midwest? A full athletic scholarship.</p>

<p>This would be a totally new experience for me. I'm from New York, grew up 50 minutes from NYC, and went to a high school surrounded by 2000 students. My freshman class in college was made up of one hundred students that I would eventually get to know by first name, last name, and major. I'll always remember that moment when I first arrived on campus. It was the fourth of August, and all of the athletes were set to arrive for summer training. I walked up to my dorm to attend an all hands on meeting for freshman athletes.</p>
    
    <p>I remember arriving with my suitcase, hand bag, dressed in a flowy a symmetrical nude dress from H&amp;M, high knee black boots, and aviators. I could just read everyone's sweatpants and sweatshirt mind.</p>

<p><blockquote>"Who the fuck is that?" they wondered.</blockquote></p>

<p>I sat next to the first person who smiled back at me. Her name was Cierra, and she would becoming my best friend. Growing up I always had a lot of freedom, friends, and was an average student graduating high school with a solid B average. The hardest transition for me in college wasn't academia, it wasn't social, it was actually athletic.</p>

<p>I signed late, therefore I got lost in the cracks when it came to the athletic department. I never received my summer training papers or word that the coach who recruited me had resigned due to him and his wife having their first child that summer. Upon arrival my coach was less than thrilled with me. He knew nothing about me, questioned my commitment, and just fucking hated me. He coached at an all girls private catholic school and was less than experienced with my unisex public school ways. He would actually talk to the other girls on the team about what I wore to practice-- confessing it would make him feel uncomfortable. What the fuck is uncomfortable about <a href="http://www.cheerleading.com/Item-CSSKO-BLK.htm" target="_blank">this skort</a>?</p>

<p>This dude sucked. In practice he would tell me to slow down even though I kept a consistent pace throughout workouts, he wasn't happy that as a freshman, I finished second in our race trials, I was simply OverIt.com. In his eyes, I would never win. I called my family numerous times in tears explaining that I loved my friends and teachers, but fucking despised my coach. For the first time in my life, I just wanted to quit. The only place I wanted to run, was away. Eventually I quit the team, finished the semester, and came home. I took a semester off from college and reevaluated my college plans. I applied to Nassau Community College to continue studying fashion design.</p>
    
<p>Now, most people on Long Island totally bitch about going to community college, but I was so thankful to be: 1. back in school, 2. back in New York, and 3. given the opportunity to start over.</p>

<p><blockquote>Transferring to community college was the best decision I ever made.</blockquote></p>

<p>During my second semester in college I changed my major to commercial arts and fell in love with the wonderful world of graphic design. This would introduce me to a few people who changed my life. Fast forward several months, I moved to New York City, and started working for a start up. I'm insanely happy with where I am in life right now and couldn't be happier. I learn something new daily and am consistently surrounded by hardworking talented individuals. None of this would have happened, if I stayed.</p>

<p>Although my time in Ohio was short, I will never forget the people I met, the bonds I made, and the great times I had. Miss you Iesha (my former roommate who is pictured above!)</p>
